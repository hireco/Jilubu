## Description
A python program to automatically generate and maintain the static personal homepage for GitHub pages, which is convenient to update synchronously.

## Why make it
I think,for most people, the server-side program is too troublesome. It's too heavy for a tiny personal website. I think a html website is enough and it is faster and more convenient to maintain and update. What database do you want? What language do you want to use? PHP? Python? Ruby? None of this is needed. You only need to upload a few files, and you'v got your website running.

## About search engine
As you can see, the URLs of the demo site contain hash, a string led by #. This makes those search engines, such as baidu,sogou, can not visit these URLs. In fact, the staticPageMaker can produce the html file of each URL so that all web crawlers can find all the pages.

## Main features
### 1.Markdown
How to write new article for the website? Markdown is the powerful tool behind it. Enjoy using markdown.
### 2.Background music
When switching to different pages, it supports continuous playing of background music.
### 3.JSON data
Dynamic pages driven by JSON data make it easy to update the content, easy to cache the history data so that browseing the page quickly. 
### 4.Responsive layout
Suitable for mainstream desktop browsers and mobile devices.

## Other tools
Of course, I know hexo, hugo,jekyll and ghost, they are very powerful and convenient, but also too sophisticated to use for many people. Too many requirements need to be installed before it can be used properly.

## A demo
